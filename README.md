# christmas-2020

christmas 2020 (inspired by apple's site)

to rotate a lot of things it seems like you need to setup all icons to each watch the page turn but NO!
it is simply having one part watching the page and then base on that rotate all the icons. all icons turn in constant rotation be it in opposite direction but they turn the same angle (we could simulate the different rotation by speeds but it might not be neccesary for this project).
